        <p> Welcome to my recipe project! This project is a revamped version of my first attempt at creating a recipe website, which was a bit messy. Through this iteration, I’ve applied the skills and techniques I’ve learned from developing a clean and user-friendly landing page which was <a href="https://navivin.github.io/project_landing-page/" target="_blank">my previous project</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The purpose of this webpage is to showcase a collection of my favorite recipes, including Chicken Adobo, Pork Sinigang, and Sisig. Each recipe is presented with detailed instructions to help you create delicious meals effortlessly. I hope this improved design makes your cooking experience more enjoyable and inspires you to try these flavorful dishes. </p>

        <p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/NaviVin/odin-recipes" target="_blank">source code on my GitHub profile</a> to explore how this project was built and to see more of my work. I’d love to hear your feedback!</p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
